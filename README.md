Abstract
This work studies the use of graph embedding techniques including graph neural networks to predict outcomes in patients with intracranial aneurysms. By simulating real-world clinical scenarios with synthetic but realistic data, the study demonstrates that models like CompGCN excel in capturing complex relationships and temporal dynamics within medical data, significantly outperforming traditional methods. This project emphasizes the importance of temporal knowledge graph embeddings and highlights the potential of advanced graph-based models to enhance predictive tools in healthcare.
